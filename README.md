# UserControlSample
This is a sample website demonstrating the user control in asp.net web forms .
<h1>What is User Control</h1>
A User Control is a reusable page or control with an extension of .ascx  and created similar to an .aspx page but the difference is that a User Control does not render on its own, it requires an .aspx page to be rendered.
 
User Controls are very useful to avoid repetition of code for similar requirements. Suppose I need a calendar control in my application with some custom requirements in multiple pages, then instead of creating the control repetitively you can create it once and use it on multiple pages.
<h5> Partial views in Asp.net MVC</h5> are similar to the user controls in the asp.net web forms, which will be uploaded in same account
